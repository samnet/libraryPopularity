=========== OVERALL ==========
What s to be done?
- FE: make the UI more compelling
- BE: the back end more professional
- INFO: work on the information content, for R
- EXT: think about where to get similar information for other language. Consign it here:
google spread sheet

Language | Pkg list | Dld info | git, so are same
R           cran      cran
Py
Js

=========== CONCRETLY ==========
no. des (priority)
FE:
9. add info boxes for each library with links to official webpage, github repo, stackoverflow stuff
T 10. have preselection. random pair from a set of 200 well known libraries
T 12. draw plotly ts must be made smarter (range, color, dates)
T 13. function colorPalette
T 14. add a box a flat with tabs (one for each selected item) that contains all relevant link
16. Have another input box, the "task". Goal of this input box is to build up a database so to be able to propose alternatives.
BE:
8. hardcode the reference for hte function data_ret.relative_pop
11. rename radar_gen to visualisation_gen and get rid of ts_gen after having copied its content (resizing) to a js file
INFO:
6. think about way of coming up with comparables (might be easier for some langauges... else nlp?) (+++)
EXTENSION
1. other languages (+)
MISC
3. commenting (+++)
17. TS is kept undefined, that enables us to give different metrics depending on the language
